# Python-Devops

## Automation 

Python has many greate Library to automate Devops task from CI/CD Pipelines to Cloud Platform and Monitoring . 

I can write python script to do automated backups cleanups on the Servers 

I can also just general tasks with Python, like when working with Excel sheets or automating some task on my Laptop  

#### Why do I need Python as a Devops Engineer ?

I am as a Devops engineer will be working with many different tools and trying to combine them . For example : 
    - Automatically update Jira ticket information after Jenkins build has run suncess . 
    
    - or Automatically trigger Jenkins jobs on some events that happen during software development process, sending notification to write team member on specific events when something happens in the system 

    - Doing regular backups for my Nexus or Jenkins servers or Application DB. 
    
    - Cleaning up all Docker images from servers to free up Server space

    - In addition to that I may need to create automation scripts or small programs for my team, for developers and testers and operations to solve some of their problems
